# 404-not_found
I replicated the '404 Not Found' webpage and made use of the dimension provided in the figma design and made slight changes to some of them to match the look actual design.
For the responsiveness I made use of '375px' as the 'max_width' to match the dimension of the phone frame in the figma design and made changes to the elements based on the phone frame.
I created a repository named '404-not_found' uploaded the files to the git-hub repository.
The created a static website on render and deployed the repository on it.
